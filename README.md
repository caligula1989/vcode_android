=============

VCode Android application - check product barcodes to determine whether they are vegan
This application scans a product barcode, and then contacts a backend server to check whether the product is vegan (contains no animal products).

It is heavily based (some parts unchanged) on the example app Barcode Scanner by ZXing. The ZXing authors retain all copyright to the parts of code which were written by them.

The code is published under the Apache license.
